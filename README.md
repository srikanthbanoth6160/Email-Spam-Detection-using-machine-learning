### 📧 Email Spam Detection  
A machine learning project to classify emails as **spam** or **ham** (not spam) using various classification models.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using **TF-IDF**  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear & RBF kernels**  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

## 💂️ Dataset  
- **Source:** Publicly available spam dataset (e.g., SMS Spam Collection, Enron emails)  
- **Preprocessing:** Stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization  


## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- Deep learning approach (LSTM, CNN)  
- Deployment as a web app
